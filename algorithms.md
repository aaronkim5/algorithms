Data structures
  - A way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications. No single data structure works well for all purposes, and so it is important to know the strenghts and limitations of several of them.

Efficient algorithms
  - Usual measure of efficiency is speed, i.e., how long an algorithm takes to produce its results.
